# Lemonade Engine
This is an Entity Component System style engine, written in JavaScript
## Getting Started
Download the engine.js file and include into your project by using the HTML tag <script src="path/to/engine.js"></script>
Then just make a canvas element and to initialize, run this code once the body has loaded:
{
	Lemonade.initialize(width, height, 'id Of Canvas element', whether to use webGL or not, and the debug mode);
}

After that is run, the engine will call a function loop every 1 millisecond. This function is to be defined by you.
